Multi staged builds
-----------------------------
In CI/CD we build applications and for building applications if we want to use docker containers 
then this multistage buildconcept will be handy

Let me give a simple example of a java application

git clone https://github.com/wakaleo/game-of-life
# java 8 installed and maven install
cd game-of-life
mvn package

In Traditional ways 
- Now after the Package is created, Ensure you have
- Dockerfile which creates the image
- Create the image and push the image to docker registry
- When you want to deploy application the pull from registry

=======================================================================================

Multistage build
-----------------------
Build the package as part of your docker image build
Create a Dockerfile as shown


FROM maven:3-openjdk-8 as builder
RUN git clone https://github.com/wakaleo/game-of-life.git
RUN cd game-of-life && mvn package

FROM tomcat:8
COPY --from=builder /game-of-life/gameoflifeweb/target/gameoflife.war  /usr/local/tomcat/webapps/gameoflife.war
EXPOSE 8080
